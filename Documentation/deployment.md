## Project Management

- **Trello Board**: [Trello - Baizonn Project](https://trello.com/invite/b/67f51829eee03e00285192f4/ATTI64a7af6dc286401e9784c4b8153bbe7b577C229A/baizonn-project)
  - Columns used: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
  

## Development Workflow

### Local Development with LocalWP

1. Install [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/).
2. Create a new local WordPress site named `baizonn.local`.
3. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cp3402-students/project-2025-tr1-jcua-team8.git
   ```
4. Place the theme folder into:
   ```
   /app/public/wp-content/themes/
   ```
5. Activate the theme in WordPress Admin Panel.

### Version Control with GitHub

- Repository: [GitHub - Baizonn Project](https://github.com/cp3402-students/project-2025-tr1-jcua-team8.git)
- Branches:
  - `main`: Staging
  - `production`: Live site

#### Git Workflow

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-header

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new header layout"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/new-header
```

## Testing Workflow

- All changes tested locally via LocalWP.
- Manual cross-browser and mobile responsiveness tests.
- Theme validated using **Theme Check** plugin.
- Checked escaping using `esc_url()`, `esc_html()` functions.
- Image compression done for files > 1MB.

## Deployment Workflow

### Staging Deployment on AWS Lightsail

1. Launch a WordPress instance on AWS Lightsail.
2. Use the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin:
   - Export `.wpress` file from local.
   - Import on staging site via plugin.
3. Alternative: Use **FileZilla** with FTP credentials from Lightsail.
   - Upload to `/wp-content/themes/baizonn`.
   - Activate the theme from WordPress Admin.

### Production Deployment on AWS Lightsail

1. Create another Lightsail instance for production.
2. Export staging site using All-in-One WP Migration.
3. Import into production WordPress Admin.
4. Final push to production branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git merge main
   git push origin production
   ```

5. Pull latest theme on server via SSH or FileZilla.

- Theme check must pass before merging production.

## [Detailed Development and Deployment Practices](#detailed-development-and-deployment-practices)

### Local Development Guidelines

- Use a modern code editor such as Visual Studio Code with the following recommended extensions:
  - PHP Intelephense (for PHP IntelliSense support)
  - Prettier (for consistent code formatting)
  - GitLens (for Git insights)
  - WordPress Snippet Pack (for faster template creation)

- Each developer works on a feature branch using `git checkout -b feature-name` and pushes changes regularly.
- Pull Requests (PRs) are reviewed by at least one team member before merging to ensure code consistency and avoid regression.

### GitHub Repository Management

- Default branch is `main`. All final changes are merged here after testing.
- Feature branches must follow naming conventions like: `feature/homepage-layout` or `fix/footer-links`.
- PRs should follow this template:
  - **Description**: Brief about whatâ€™s implemented.
  - **Linked Trello Card**: Include the URL of the related card.
  - **Screenshots**: Optional screenshots for frontend changes.
  - **Testing**: Describe how to test the change locally.

### Staging Server (AWS Lightsail)

- IP: `<staging-ip-address>`
- Used for internal team reviews.
- Developers push to `main`, triggering GitHub Actions which SSH into the staging server, navigate to the theme folder and perform a `git pull`.

### Production Server (AWS Lightsail)

- IP: `<production-ip-address>`
- Used for client demo or final site review.
- Only stable releases are pushed to the `production` branch.

### GitHub Actions Setup

- Environment secrets include:
  - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_STAGING`
  - `STAGING_VM_IP`
  - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION`
  - `PRODUCTION_VM_IP`
- Scripts execute securely without exposing private keys.

### Security Measures

- Do not store `.env` or secret config files in the GitHub repo.
- Do not expose database credentials or API keys in theme files.
- Regularly update plugins and WordPress core.

### Backup & Recovery

- Weekly backups taken via All-in-One WP Migration or via Lightsail snapshot.
- Before every deployment to production, a snapshot is recommended.
